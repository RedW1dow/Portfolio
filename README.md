## Introduction
My name is Ronny Arellano and during my entire career in technology in both the civilian and military industries, software development was always something I enjoyed doing on my time off. I have also always looked at ways in which custom software could improve my day-to-day tasks. Most of work is done through self-study and paying attention to best practices that are mentioned by other software devs.
